# interactive-rating-component
This is a project from the frontendmentor.io site.
When, I click on a rating from 1 to 5. A thank you window apparently with the rating and some text.

I managed everything on a single HTML file using the display property with the value none to hide what is hidden. Data processing is done in JavaScript with an event listener when the submit button is clicked. The note choice section disappears to leave the thank you section.
I used another click event listener to capture the note chosen by the user and for that I used the forEach() method.
The choice of color on click is also done with a click event listener.
